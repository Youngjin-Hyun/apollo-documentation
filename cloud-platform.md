## Baidu services

Baidu provides [a simulation environment called “DreamLand”](http://bce.apollo.auto/). It offers two mode: worldsim is based on hand-crafted environment and logsim is based on data recorded in the real world. This service is only accessible to invited partners. They also advertise [a Unity-based simulator](https://spark.adobe.com/page/nL9jDGM15xrxS/), not available yet.

Baidu also [distributes dataset](http://data.apollo.auto/?locale=en-us&lang=en) for the usage of perception or localization algorithms in Apollo.

An [extrinsic calibration service](https://login.bce.baidu.com/?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fconsole.bce.baidu.com%2Fapollo%2Fcalibrator%2Findex%2Flist%3Flocale%3Den-us&lang=en) is also available online but requires a phone number outside the EU and is apparently only usable from the USA.

An HDMap generation service is also hosted by Baidu but after discussion with them, the service is not accessible to Europe and costs 2000$ per km.
